# Eorzea Launcher (Final Fantasy XIV)
[README em Português](README-pt.md)

Simple and Clean Final Fantasy XIV launcher that doesn’t require you to repeatedly enter login credentials or OTP.

*If you don’t have OTP enabled on your account, as a cybersecurity professional, I highly recommend you do so :) *

## FAQ
1. What is an OTP?
   - OTP stands for "One-Time Password." It is a temporary password generated for a single authentication session or transaction. OTPs are used as an additional authentication factor to increase security, especially in login processes and financial transactions. They are typically generated by a specific device or application and have a short validity period, which helps protect against interception and password reuse attacks.
2. How to get my OTP Secret to insert into the Script?

      1. Click the Google Authenticator icon
      2. Click the gear icon

   2. Directly from Mog Station
      1. If you have OTP configured in your account, first you need to remove it to reactivate.
      2. Go to Mog Station, login and click at "One Time Password"

      3. Click at Software Authenticator

      3. Click Sofware Authenticator Registration

      4. The website displays a QR code. You need to scan it with your OTP app, like Google Authenticator, Authy, etc., and also scan it with a QR code reader to obtain the OTP secret. When you do this, you will see something similar to the image below. Copy the highlighted part and use it to configure this tool.

   3. Configured in other authenticators
      - Every OTP has a secret, you need to find a way to obtain this secret, either by backing up your OTP as shown above or by scanning the QR Code with your phone's camera and a QR Code reader. If you do it differently and want to contribute, please contact me so I can add your method here :)
3. I don’t have OTP enabled on my account. How do I enable OTP?
   - Link to activate your OTP: [Square Enix Authenticator](https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/seaccount/otp/authenticator.html)
4. I made a mistake typing my password and/or OTP code, what should I do?
   - Delete the eorzea_launcher.config configuration file and run the program again.
5. I changed my password and/or OTP, what should I do?
   - Delete the eorzea_launcher.config configuration file and run the program again.
6. My computer is acting up, clicking and typing randomly.
   - The Launcher works through a timer, and the screen may not have fully loaded on your computer yet. You need to configure the times you want for each screen load. To do this, after completing the program's configuration step, open the eorzea_launcher.config file and set the variables starting with `waiting_time_to_...` in seconds, save the configuration file, and run the program again. Monitor the seconds in the executable to check for inconsistencies.
